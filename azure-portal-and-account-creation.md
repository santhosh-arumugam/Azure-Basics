# Azure Portal Overview: Navigating Your Cloud Journey

In this guide, we'll explore the Azure portal, providing an overview of what it looks like, how to create an Azure account, and understanding key concepts such as tenants, subscriptions, and resource groups.

## Creating an Azure Account

To get started with Azure, you'll need an Azure account. Follow these steps to create one:

1. Open your web browser and go to your preferred search engine.
2. Type "Azure free account" and click on the official link provided.
3. Azure offers a free account option with $200 in Azure credits that you can use within the first 30 days.
4. After the initial 30 days, your account will be deactivated unless you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription.
5. PAYG allows you to pay only for the services you use, making it a flexible and cost-effective choice.
6. Azure provides many free services, with some available for an entire year and others for a 12-month period.

## Azure Free Account for Students

If you're a student, you can create an Azure free account without needing a credit card. Here's how:

1. In your preferred search engine, search for "Azure free account for students."
2. Click on the official link, which offers $100 in Azure credits for students.
3. This free account is ideal for learning, and you can enjoy these credits for 12 months without a credit card requirement.

## Getting Started with the Azure Portal

Once you have an Azure account, you can log in to the Azure portal by visiting "portal.azure.com." There, you'll find a user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Azure resources.

## Exploring the Azure Portal

Now, let's take a closer look at how the Azure portal is structured:

1. **Tenant (Account):** When you create an Azure account, a tenant is established. A tenant is a higher-level container for your Azure resources.

2. **Subscription:** Within the tenant, you can create one or more subscriptions. Subscriptions help you organize and manage your resources efficiently. Many organizations create separate subscriptions for development, testing, and production environments.

3. **Resource Group:** Within each subscription, you can create resource groups. Think of resource groups as folders that allow you to manage multiple resources collectively.

4. **Resources:** Resources are the individual components or services you use within Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, or web applications.

## Creating a Resource Group

To create a resource group:

1. Navigate to your subscription within the Azure portal.
2. Click on "Resource groups" in the left sidebar.
3. You can create a new resource group by clicking on the "Add" button.

With your resource group in place, you're ready to start adding resources to it. This structure helps keep your Azure environment organized and makes resource management efficient.

## Exploring Azure Resources

Azure offers a wide range of services and resources, categorized into various sections. You can easily search for and create resources by using the "Create a resource" option. Explore categories like AI and machine learning, databases, IoT, and much more.
